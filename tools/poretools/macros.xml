Poretools: a toolkit for working with nanopore sequencing data from Oxford Nanopore.
====================================================================================

The MinION (TM) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) is the first nanopore sequencer to be commercialised and is now available to early-access users. The MinION (TM) is a USB-connected, portable nanopore sequencer which permits real-time analysis of streaming event data. Currently, the research community lacks a standardized toolkit for the analysis of nanopore datasets.

We have therefore develped poretools, a flexible toolkit for exploring datasets generated by nanopore sequencing devices from MinION for the purposes of quality control and downstream analysis. Poretools operates directly on the native FAST5 (a variant of the HDF5 standard) file format produced by ONT and provides a wealth of format conversion utilities and data exploration and visualization tools.
